# Wordish
This is a Wordle clone.

The object of the game is to guess the keyword in 6 or less attemps.

If you input a word that does not consist of all letters or is less than 5 letters long, the game will not move on to the next row.

Towards the bottom are two rows of "* * * * *". The first row will display the letters of the keyword if they match the letters of your input word.

Between the two rows of "* * * * *", will display letters for your input word that are in the keyword but do not match with the index of the keyword letters.

The second row of "* * * * *" will display the keyword upon completing all 6 guessing attempts, or guessing the keyword correctly at any point.

There is also a restart button to start the game over at any point.

When the game is over you must press the restart button if you would like to play again.
